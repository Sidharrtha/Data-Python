Question 1: Sum of Numbers
Problem Description:
Write a Python program that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 100.

Expected Output:
The output should be the total sum, which is 5050.

Question 2: List of Squares
Problem Description:
Create a Python program that uses a for loop to generate a list of the squares of the first 10 integers (1 through 10).

Expected Output:
The output should be a list: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].

Question 3: Character Count
Problem Description:
Write a Python script that asks the user for a string and then uses a for loop to count how many times the letter 'a' appears in that string.

Expected Inputs and Outputs:

If the user inputs the string "banana", the output should be "The letter 'a' appears 3 times."
Question 4: Factorial Calculator
Problem Description:
Create a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a for loop. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Expected Inputs and Outputs:

If the user inputs 5, the output should be 120 (since 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120).
Question 5: Multiplication Table
Problem Description:
Write a program that uses a for loop to print the multiplication table (up to 10) for a number entered by the user.

Expected Output:
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
...
3 x 10 = 30

Question 6: Reverse a String
Problem Description:
Write a Python program that uses a for loop to reverse a given string input by the user.

Expected Inputs and Outputs:

If the user inputs the string "hello", the output should be "olleh".

Question 7: Even Numbers Filter
Problem Description:
Create a Python script that uses a for loop to print out all even numbers from 1 to 50.

Expected Output:
The program should print all even numbers between 1 and 50, each on a new line.

Question 8: Count Down Timer
Problem Description:
Write a program that asks the user for a number and then counts down to zero from that number using a for loop. Include a message at the end that says "Time's up!"

Expected Inputs and Outputs:

If the user inputs 5, the output should be:
css
Copy code
5
4
3
2
1
0
Time's up!

Question 9: List Multiplication
Problem Description:
Create a program that takes a list of numbers and uses a for loop to multiply each element by 2, then prints the new list.

Expected Output:

For the input list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the output should be [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].

Question 10: Prime Number Checker
Problem Description:
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and then uses a for loop to check if the number is a prime number.

Expected Inputs and Outputs:

If the user inputs 29, the output should state "29 is a prime number."
If the user inputs 10, the output should state "10 is not a prime number."
